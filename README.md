# git-repo-render

`git-repo-render` is a command-line tool that generates a comprehensive view of a Git repository's structure and file contents. It's designed to provide a quick and easy way to understand the layout and content of a project.

## Features

- Displays the directory structure of a Git repository
- Shows the content of each file
- Ignores the `.git` directory to focus on the actual project files
- Outputs the result to a file for easy viewing and sharing

## Installation

To install `git-repo-render`, you need to have Go installed on your system.

```
$ go build
```

## Usage

To use `git-repo-render`, run the following command:

```
$ git-repo-render <repository_path> [output_file]
```

- `<repository_path>`: The path to the Git repository you want to render
- `[output_file]`: (Optional) The name of the file to write the output to. If not specified, it defaults to "output.txt"

Example:

```
$ git-repo-render /path/to/your/repo my_repo_structure.txt
```

This will create a file named `my_repo_structure.txt` containing the structure and contents of the repository.

## Output Format

The output file will contain two main sections:

1. Directory Structure: A tree-like representation of the repository's file and directory structure.
2. File Contents: The contents of each file, preceded by its relative path within the repository.

Example output:

```
